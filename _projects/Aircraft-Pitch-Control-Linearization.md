title: Aircraft Pitch Control Linearization
description: This was a group project done for the class MAE 3260. We selected to analyze aircraft pitch control, its linearization, design requirements, model simplifications, state space modeling, and the resulting transfer functions.
technologies: [SolidWorks, Machining]

Acknowledgements: This was a group project, with work on this project done in collaboration with Michelle Mobius, Audrey Garon, and Parker McLaughlin. This project was a preliminary research piece into aircraft pitch control, not intended to be a defining paper on the subject but rather an initial inquery into the topic and how system dynamics principles and concepts can be applied.
